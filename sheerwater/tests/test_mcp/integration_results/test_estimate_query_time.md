## Prompt

Using sheerwater, estimate how long it would take to compare ECMWF and FuXi for Kenya precipitation

## Response

Both queries are estimated to complete in **under 1 minute** each. The results are likely cached, which means the comparison should be fast.

For a comparison of ECMWF IFS and FuXi for Kenya precipitation:
- **Region size**: ~500 grid cells
- **Cache status**: Likely cached for both models
- **Total estimated time**: Under 2 minutes for both models combined

Would you like me to run the actual comparison?
