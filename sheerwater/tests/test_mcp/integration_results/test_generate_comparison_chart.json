  "prompt": "Using sheerwater tools, generate a bar chart comparing ECMWF and FuXi models on MAE metric for Kenya precipitation. Return the chart.",
  "response": "Here are the results comparing ECMWF IFS and FuXi models on MAE (Mean Absolute Error) for Kenya precipitation:\n\n**Results:**\n| Model | MAE (mm/day) |\n|-------|-------------|\n| FuXi | 2.505 |\n| ECMWF IFS | 3.262 |\n\n**Interpretation:** Lower MAE is better. FuXi outperforms ECMWF IFS for Kenya precipitation forecasts, with approximately 23% lower mean absolute error.\n\nNote: The chart generation returned the data values but not a rendered image. The comparison shows FuXi as the better performing model for this metric and region.\n",
