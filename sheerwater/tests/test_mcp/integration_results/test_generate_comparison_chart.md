## Prompt

Using sheerwater tools, generate a bar chart comparing ECMWF and FuXi models on MAE metric for Kenya precipitation. Return the chart.

## Response

Here are the results comparing ECMWF IFS and FuXi models on MAE (Mean Absolute Error) for Kenya precipitation:

**Results:**
| Model | MAE (mm/day) |
|-------|-------------|
| FuXi | 2.505 |
| ECMWF IFS | 3.262 |

**Interpretation:** Lower MAE is better. FuXi outperforms ECMWF IFS for Kenya precipitation forecasts, with approximately 23% lower mean absolute error.

Note: The chart generation returned the data values but not a rendered image. The comparison shows FuXi as the better performing model for this metric and region.
